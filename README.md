## E's
E's is an app that allows students to deliver to other students in a community based delivery service. Students can either request a delivery, or if convenient deliver for others; in return they get the price of the delivery with a tip of the students choice.
- Students can get cheap items like coffees delivered to them for a small fee
- Deliverers can make extra cash by organizing jobs based off of their class routes or destination
